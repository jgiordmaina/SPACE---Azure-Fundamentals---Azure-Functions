Prerequisites
- Visual Studio Code installed on one of the supported platforms.
- Azure Functions extension. You can also install the Azure Tools extension pack, which is recommended for working with Azure resources.
- An active Azure subscription. If you don't yet have an account, you can create one from the extension in Visual Studio Code.

You also need these prerequisites to run and debug your functions locally. They aren't required to just create or publish projects to Azure Functions.

The Azure Functions Core Tools, which enables an integrated local debugging experience. When you have the Azure Functions extension installed, the easiest way to install or update Core Tools is by running the Azure Functions: Install or Update Azure Functions Core Tools command from the command palette.
The C# extension for Visual Studio Code.

.NET (CLI), which is included in the .NET SDK.
